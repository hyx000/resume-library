Akhil Garg, born in March 1988, Indian, doctor, associate professor and tutor of master's degree in mechanical engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. He obtained bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from National Institute of Technology , Rourkela in the May 2010. In August 2014, he received a doctorate degree in mechanical and aerospace engineering from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. From September 2014 to March 2016, he was engaged in postdoctoral research in the School of Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. From March 2016 to August 2016, he worked as a lecturer in Shantou University in School of Mechatronics Engineering. From September 2016 to July 2019, he worked as an associate professor at Shantou University. In August 2019, he joined School of Mechanical Science and Engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
The main research directions include the application of evolutionary algorithm and artificial intelligence in engineering design or design optimization, such as energy storage system design. In the past five years, SCI papers has been published in International Journals such as Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, Applied Soft Computing, Expert Systems with Applications, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, Journal of Power Sources, Energy and other journals. 96 papers, including 2 ESI hot papers and 10 ESI highly cited papers, H index 21. He presided over the project of "sailing plan" in Guangdong Province to introduce the top talents in short supply. He is currently guest editor of SCI Journal "Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing" and served as a reviewer of more than 30 SCI journals.
